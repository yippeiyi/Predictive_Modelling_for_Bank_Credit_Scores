# Predictive Modelling for Bank Credit_Scores

The purpose of this assignment is to build a machine intelligent system that distinguishes customers into credit score brackets for better efficiency. The algorithm used in this predictive modelling analysis is the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm which is best suited for small datasets as well as performing classification learning. Furthermore, specific python machine learning packages such as Scikit-learn were used for the entirety of this project.
